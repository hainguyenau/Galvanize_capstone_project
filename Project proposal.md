### *Name*: Hai Nguyen Au
### *Title*: Natural Language Processing Analysis of Donald J. Trump's Tweets


#### **Abstract:**

Our presidential election is coming to the final stage in the next few months. It has become more and more common for candidates to utilize social media and other online tools to boost their campaigns. This time, we saw candidate Donald J. Trump use Twitter as one of his main media to project his points of view to the public. As a statistical study from http://www.trackalytics.com/ shows, the number of his Twitter followers has gone from 3 millions to more than 11.5 millions since he started his campaign in June 2015. In addition, his Twitter posts are usually controversial and have been discussed constantly by the media. In this project, I will Natural Language Processing to analyze and deduce some insights about the topics he talks about in his tweets. Results of sentiment analyses such as who and what topics he talks about most, or what words he frequenly used may give us some ideas about why his campaign has been successful despite his being unconventional and controversial. If time permits, I would like to run the same algorithm for Hillary Clintons' tweets to have a good comparisons between the two candidates.
