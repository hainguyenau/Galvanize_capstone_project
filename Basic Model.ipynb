Then , in a dark cloud of transition , voices were taught the seeds of angst and tolerance for the supposedly intolerable. This birthed dissension from the mentalities of the ordained orders of things , and a popular front of musical angst was born. It was a multi-headed beast wearing the adornments of scorn for things it saw copulating around its eyes , for the traps mankind waltzed within while traversing on the proverbial toes of one another , and it found itself jaded and somewhat affected by these notions. So , something bleak and menacing in its own rights began to morph and take root as a mouthpiece to minds it likened as something like itself. After a time , the works grew into heavily voxed machines and electronic beats drumming away on all fronts of humanity , taking the forms of bands like Informatik and their initial release , Direct Memory Access 2.0 .

The first floor of these houses is set at ground level or is raised up off of the earth slightly , with a short set of steps providing access to the front door. The door frame is often the most ornate element of the entire facade. The door itself is surrounded by sidelights and a transom , and further surrounded by a series of wood moldings designed to imitate some form of classical details usually borrowed from the architecture of ancient Greece. The second floor of the house would most often feature a balcony which could be reached through full length window openings on that floor. On earlier townhouses , the second floor was the only location for balconies which were usually fitted with simple wrought-iron railings . ',\n",

       " 'There is currently a strong focus worldwide on the potential of large-scale Electronic Health Record systems to cut costs and improve patient outcomes through increased e ciency. A number of countries are developing nationwide EHR systems to aggregate services currently provided by isolated Electronic Medical Record databases. However , such aggregation introduces new risks for patient privacy and data security , both by linking previously-separate pieces of information about an individual , and by creating single access points to a wide range of personal data. It is thus essential that new access control policies and mechanisms are devised for federated Electronic Health Record systems , to ensure not only that sensitive patient data is accessible by authorized personnel only , but also that it is available when needed in life-critical situations. Here we review the traditional security models for access control , Discretionary Access Control , Mandatory Access Control and Role-Based Access Control , and use a case study to demonstrate that no single one of them is su cient in a federated healthcare environment. We then show how the required level of data security can be achieved through a judicious combination of all three mechanisms . ',\n",

This goal was partly met by national deals for access to e-journals in 2002. The national deals in Iceland opened access not only to the academic community but also to the general public. Libraries in Iceland are publicly funded and the argument was that access paid by public funding should allow open access to e-journals for all Icelanders , at work or at home. The national deals cover access to a few of the main publishers with access to about 3.000 4.000 e-journals. The funding is covered by the acquisition funds from few of the main research libraries in Iceland. There is very little central funding for this project. The financial burden is on few research libraries. This is a heavy burden and does limit funding for other more specified journals such as Nature and Cell Press which were too expensive to be included in the national deal. The outcome is that there is good open access to the more general journals but more limited access to specialist journals . ',\n",

Understandings of rural space that inform policy-making are peculiarly dominated by the rhetorical and political power of private property. It is access and commons that give an opportunity to confront this. The article draws on an example of a challenge by a landowner to the heralded public access provisions of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to demonstrate the inadequate versions of access and the public presence that the current deference to private property is producing. The ensuing Public Inquiry was premised on an inadequate conception of public rights to space and a concomitant privileging of private property. In several ways the Inquiry set out deliberately to exclude the voices and claims of publics. The article identifies four primary areas in which the possibilities for promoting a new public presence in rural space via access and commons coincide . ',\n",

The feasibility and safety of this access route were tested with multiple repetitions in all 19 animals. At the end of each of the 17 acute experiments , direct inspection after thoracotomy revealed no hemopericardium , laceration , or bleeding on catheter withdrawal. In 24-hour survival studies performed in 2 of the 6 dogs , the animals exhibited no behavioral signs of discomfort or untoward consequences on recovery from anesthesia.

Its main goal was restore a competitive balance of the STM journals publishing market ... .Since two years SPARC puts a special emphasis on Open Access , including institutional repositories. The paper gives an overview of the activities of SPARC and its partners in these areas. The results are evaluated and compared with the measures defined in 1997.

       " 'In order to become more involved in the process of developing affordable housing for people with disabilities , disability organizations need access to information , technical assistance , and examples of successful strategies that will enhance their capacity to participate effectively in efforts to establish integrated , affordable , and accessible housing. They also need information that will enable them to become involved with State and local activities that promote affordable housing and to integrate the needs and interests of people with disabilities into well-established State and local fair housing networks. A national housing technical assistance center would fill this role. It could also undertake targeted research on topics including potential advantages and drawbacks of housing models , such as Limited-Equity Cooperatives and other co-ops , as housing alternatives to single-family homes , lifelong rentals , and congregate housing .

Such an approach would require the Commission to establish general standards for different levels of pricing flexibility , actively monitor the behavior and business practices of the incumbent LECs in both the local and interstate markets , and review claims by the incumbent LECs that they meet the requirements for phase 1 , 2 , or 3 of access reform .

       " \"Much work on persistent programming languages has followed the principle of persistence by reachability whereby an object is persistent if and only if it is reachable via one or more ' persistent roots ' . Examples are systems such as PJama [ 1 ] and PerDiS [ 9 ] which provide a special persistent object store to manage persistence transparently according to this principle. This approach has a number of problems in terms of information security and access control since a piece of data can not be considered to be ' held inside ' a persistent container object as is the case with Jarrah. Many references to a piece of data can be passed around and stored in the system. One problem with this is that the data can not be explicitly deleted. As long as one reference via a persistent root still exists , the data will continue to exist. The problem in terms of access control is that it can not be guaranteed that an access to the data will occur via a well-defined high-level interface method and so access constraints can not be formulated or enforced in terms of these methods. In addition , these systems can not support different realisations of persistence for different components of an application . \",\n",
